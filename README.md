Make sure you have this in your path:
     https://pbx.sh/meimagetool-fragment.tar.gz

You can extract the binaries from an image by running
	# save your ME region as clean_rom.bin
	make extract

If you want to use a newly created ME region (by FITC) you can directly extract
your MFS using
	mfstool x region/MFS.mep mfs
	meconfigtool x mfs/intel.cfg intel_cfg
	meconfigtool x mfs/fitc.cfg fitc_cfg

Otherwise, grab your ME region and extract this in your homedir
	https://pbx.sh/config_spt_lp.tar.gz 

You will also need the AFS_region_400K.bin file which is a resource in Intel's
Flash Image Tool

The constants in this repo are set for firmware 11.0.1205, but adapting them 
should be easy once I publish my writeup.

This image will not boot, but it will enable debugging.
